![The Process](http://development.luminogurus.com/abhidhana/img/Abhidhana_low.jpg)

The app makes it possible for two users of different languages to communicate with each other. The app is a real time translator with the help of which you can have an uninterrupted conversation with a person whose language you don’t even understand. All you have to do is, speak into the app and the app will take care of the rest. Whatever you speak into the app will be translated into the selected language and be spoken out at the other end of the conversation. All this is done in real time. So there are no hassles of listening the audio minutes after the actual conversation. This app has the support for 8 languages so far but now it This app is one of a kind and will hopefully be the new standard for web chat apps. 


__The vision:__ We aim at breaking the language barrier that we often face when meeting people from outside our local reign. To be precise, we feel the need to have interpreters between people of different countries. We aim to develop a web app that would help a chinese speak in chinese and still be understandable to somebody from Japan. It will be one of its kind web app.

__The Challenge:__ At first breath, the project seems to be simple and precise but the process involved had some exhausting steps. It was converting one language “X” (that we don’t know) into a language “Y” (we don’t know that too). and speaking the converted output to the user. Among most apps that are prevalent today, none of them are accurate. We aim at developing something near perfect that is non existing today.

__The Name:__ An abhidhāna (Sanskrit: अभिधान, IPA: [əbʱid̪ʱɑːn̪ə](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Sanskrit)) is a kind of dictionary or vocabulary of Sanskrit. Its purpose was to be used as a general guide for lexicography and word choice. Many of these works had been created in India.

__The future of our vision:__
The PRESENT scope : Presently, our app has support to 8 languages(we hope its good to begin with), which will be increase with time.
These languages are  English. Italian, Spanish, Japanese, German, French, Netherlands, Portuguese.
 
Presently our app will help the people of these 8 languages to translate into any of these languages with the help of a medium they have to speak into. This will help them do a variety of functions : 

People with these dialects can chat and communicate with ease.
This app, when installed to a medium, can be carried and used as a virtual interpreter.(and you don’t have to pay for it.   :P)
Can be used by industries who  like to carry their resources to a different country and still be able to have a decent conversation with the local recruits.
It can be used by tourists travelling to different countries without worrying about the need of a translator.

__*ALL IN ALL IT REMOVES THE LANGUAGE BARRIER*__

__Future scope:__

1. Our app will be able to understand full stops and pauses between sentences to translate more accurately.
* In the future this app will support more languages and be available to other regions of the map.
* We aim to make this app a good listener as well. Hope it understands that you are angry and tells the same while translating.
* Our app is mostly accurate while translating, but we aim to smoothen the experience.
* Our app works only on Google Chrome but we will like it to be native to android, iOS and some other browsers.
* It presently speaks out the translation only in female voice. We aim to bring it more life by giving it different genders and accent.

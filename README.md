abhidhana
=========

__The vision:__ We aim at breaking the language barrier that we often face when meeting people from outside our local reign. To be precise, we feel the need to have interpreters between people of different countries. We aim to develop a web app that would help a chinese speak in chinese and still be understandable to somebody from Japan. It will be one of its kind web app.

__The Challenge:__ At first breath, the project seems to be simple and precise but the process involved had some exhausting steps. It was converting one language “X” (that we don’t know) into a language “Y” (we don’t know that too). and speaking the converted output to the user. Among most apps that are prevalent today, none of them are accurate. We aim at developing something near perfect that is non existing today.

__The Name:__ An abhidhāna (Sanskrit: अभिधान, IPA: [əbʱid̪ʱɑːn̪ə](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Sanskrit)) is a kind of dictionary or vocabulary of Sanskrit. Its purpose was to be used as a general guide for lexicography and word choice. Many of these works had been created in India.
